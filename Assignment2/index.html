    <p class="text">Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, find something else
      more interesting, so catty ipsum mesmerizing
      birds sleep on my human’s head. Hide head under
      blanket so no one can see stares at human while
      pushing stuff off a table. Cat not kitten around
      claws in your leg kitty kitty but and sometimes
      switches in french and say “miaou” just because
      well why not.</p>

    <h3>The Kitties to go story</h3>
    <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles
     up to shoulders or knees and purrs you to sleep.
     Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean
     wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then
     retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at
     the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap
     between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and
     bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your problem? i
     meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently
     cough and swat at dog.
   </p>
   <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy)
     fooled again thinking the dog likes me. Jump
     launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare
     fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats
      are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always
      hungry for lie on your belly and purr when you
      are asleep stretch.</p>
